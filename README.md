# Farm2c Demo

This repository contains a simple static website that showcases a mock online store for fruits and vegetables available in Andhra and Telangana. The design draws inspiration from bigbasket and Amazon and provides a basic search function to filter products on the page.

## Getting Started

No dependencies are required. Open `public/index.html` in a web browser to view the site.

## Project Structure

- `public/index.html` – main web page
- `public/style.css` – basic styles for layout and product cards
- `public/script.js` – small script for searching products

Feel free to customize the content or styling to match your needs.
